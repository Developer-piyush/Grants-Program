# Mintbase Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** De3Verse
- **Team Name:** De3Verse
- **Payment Address:** de3verse.near
- **[Level](../README.md#level_slider-levels):** 1, 2 or 3


## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

De3Verse is an open-metaverse platform that functions on the near blockchain. At De3Verse, we have lands that are owned by users as NFTs. Owners can customize their land as they wish, similar to the metaverse. We also have a central city that hosts clubs, DJ's, a movie theater, streets, music, and business headquarters.

With this proposal, we are proposing to build tools (Unity-SDK) that will allow game developers to easily integrate games with NEAR/MINTBASE/NFTs on NEAR.

### Overview

**How our project relates to / integrates into the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?** <br>
De3Verse is an open-metaverse platform that functions on the near blockchain. In De3Verse, we have lands that are owned by users as NFTs. Owners can customize their land as they wish, similar to the metaverse. We also have a central city that hosts clubs, DJs, a movie theater, streets, music, and business headquarters. <br>

At De3Verse, our vision is to expand the open-metaverse platform so that anyone can build, explore, meet friends, and enjoy/host events at the same time. In addition to this, we are proposing to develop helpful tools for other game developers to easily build games that integrate with the near blockchain.

**Why is this required in the ecosystem?** <br> 
To drive extensive growth of games/NFT-games in the near ecosystem, it is important to focus on making unity/unreal SDKs open-source and available to help new blockchain developers build blockchain-based games that integrate seamlessly with NFTs on near. <br> <br>
As the founder & buildorr of de3verse, an open metaverse platform on the near protocol, I understand the difficulties developers may face when proper tools and descriptions are not available. We faced many issues when integrating the near wallet into our unity (WEBGL) based metaverse. The unity tools and definitions currently available on GitHub/Google are not compatible with unity/WEBGL for the near blockchain, which caused unnecessary delays. To make it easier for other game developers to build blockchain-based games, we are building this tool (unity-SDK).

To solve this problem for other game developers, we are proposing to develop an end-to-end unity-SDK that will help new game developers seamlessly build games that integrate with the near blockchain and NFTs, compatible with WEBGL and more. We will also maintain this as open-source for everyone to use freely without any restrictions.

### Ecosystem Fit

De3Verse is an open-metaverse platform that functions on the near blockchain, proposing to build helpful tools/SDKs for other game developers to build anything in integration with near/NFTs on near blockchain. <br>
<br>
**Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?** <br>
To solve the hardship of building blockchain based games in integration with NEAR/NFTs for game developers, we are proposing to develop an end-to-end unity-SDK that will help new game developers to build blockchain based games seamlessly that integrates with the near blockchain and NFTs, compatible with WEBGL and more. We will also maintain this as open-source for everyone to use freely without any restrictions. 
<br><br>
**Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?** <br>
Target audience includes all the game developers who wants to build games in integration with near, mintbase and NFTs on near.
<br><br>
**What need(s) does your project meet?** <br>
Recently we found out that, many individuals are trying to integrate NFTs/'Near blockchain' into their unity game but most of the resources that are currently availble on internet are EVM chain related and there are negligible solutions of such kind when it comes to near protocol. There were some of the users asking for such solution in different groups/channels of near blockchain, which confirms the need/requirement of such solutions in the ecosystem.
<br><br>
**Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?** <br>
There are no direct solutions of such kind currently on NEAR/MINTBASE but when it comes to EVM chains, there are many solution that exists: like recently one of the biggest EVM wallet (metam....) officially announced unity/unreal SDK to build blockchain based games seamlessly.
<br><br>
**If so, how is your project different?** <br>
Our project will empower game developers including those who don't know much about near protocol, to build games in integration with near/mintbase/NFTs on near.
 <br><br>
**If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?** <br>
Yep, when it comes to EVM/SOLANA etc.. there are many official solutions to build games in integration with respective chains. Recently one of the biggest EVM wallet(metamask) officially announced unity/unreal SDK to build blockchain games in integration with blockchain.

### Team's experience

We are the buidler of an open-metaverse platform 'De3Verse - THE FUTURE' functioning and live on near blockchain. We have relevant experience to work on proposed project effortlessly as we have already made unity-based metaverse live and getting used by lots of users in the ecosystem to build themselves homes, offices in the metaverse. <br>
De3verse is made in unity which hosts lands and central entertainment hub. In De3Verse, we have lands that are owned by users as NFTs. Owners can customize their land as they wish, similar to the metaverse. We also have a central city that hosts clubs, DJs, a movie theater, streets, music, and business headquarters. <br><br>

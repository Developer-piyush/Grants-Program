- Continuous improvement of De3Verse: Devote resources to enhancing De3Verse, our open metaverse platform: Continuously improve and update De3Verse to provide an engaging and smooth browsing experience for users. Optimize the platform's performance, usability, and interface to ensure seamless navigation and interaction within the metaverse. This includes streamlining the user interface, optimizing loading times, and addressing any reported bugs or issues promptly.
- Game development tools for blockchain-based games: Develop tools to assist game developers in building blockchain-based games: Create a suite of user-friendly tools and resources that simplify the process of developing blockchain-based games within De3Verse. Provide developers with frameworks, libraries, and documentation that seamlessly integrate with NEAR, MINTBASE, and NFTs on the NEAR blockchain. These tools will enable developers to leverage the benefits of blockchain technology and incorporate NFT functionalities into their games effortlessly.
- Enthusiastic and utility-based NFTs: Foster the creation of enthusiastic and utility-based NFTs: Encourage artists, creators, and developers to produce NFTs that offer both enthusiasm and utility within De3Verse. Support the creation of visually appealing and unique NFTs that serve a practical purpose within the metaverse, such as in-game items, virtual collectibles, or exclusive digital assets. By promoting the development and integration of these utility-based NFTs, we enhance the overall value and utility of the metaverse ecosystem.
- Land Ownership with NFTs: Establish secure land ownership through NFTs: Implement a robust system that utilizes NFTs to authenticate and verify land ownership within De3Verse. Each plot of virtual land will be represented by a unique NFT, providing indisputable proof of ownership on the NEAR blockchain. This system ensures transparent and immutable land ownership records, giving users complete control over their virtual properties.
- Create some easy tutorials for new developers to get started with.
- Keep improving user experience and contribute in the growth of near/mintbase ecosystem.
- Legalize the platform and expand the team accordingly to turn this into a fully fledged long-term sustainable product.
